# Neural-Architecture-Search-Survey
Survey of papers on Neural Architecture Search

## Task Decription
Instead of manually adapting a single state-of-art architecture for a new task, the algorithm would discover a set of best-suited and high-performing architectures on given data.

## Methods
### Evolutional Strategies
