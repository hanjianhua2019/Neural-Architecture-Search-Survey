# Neural-Architecture-Search (NAS) Survey
Survey of papers on Neural Architecture Search

## Task Decription
Instead of manually adapting a single state-of-art architecture for a new task, the algorithm would discover a set of best-suited and high-performing architectures on given data.

## Main Components [1]
**Search Space**: The search space defines which architectures can be represented in principle.
**Search Strategy**: The search strategy details how to explore the search space.
**Performance Estimation Strategy**: The process of estimating the performance.

## Methods
### Evolutional Strategies
